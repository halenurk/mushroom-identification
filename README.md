Mushroom identification using machine learning
This repo includes implementation of following models for mushroom identification (predicting whether it is poisonuous or not):
Logistic regression
Random forest
Decision tree
Naive Bayes
kNN (Euclidean distance)
kNN (Hamming distance)

Best results were achieved with random forest model (see the slides in the repo). Evaluation is done by cross-validation (details are in slides).
